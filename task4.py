# TASK-1
# Write a function:
# def solution(A)
# that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
# For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
# Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
# Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

numbers = [1, 2, 6, 4, 1, 2]

# ==========================
# TASK-2
# A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones
# at both ends in the binary representation of N.
# For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2.
# The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.
# The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.
# The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
# The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(N)
#
# that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap.
# The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.
#
# For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

    return longest(new_string) if True else 0

# ============================
# TASK-3
# An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one
# index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation
# of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the
# first place).
# The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
# Write a function:
# def solution(A, K)
# that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
# For example, given
#     A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
#     K = 3
# the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:
#     [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
#     [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
#     [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
# For another example, given
#     A = [0, 0, 0]
#     K = 1
# the function should return [0, 0, 0]
# Given
#     A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#     K = 4
# the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Assume that:
# N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
